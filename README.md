# Supporting Materials
**Explainability in AI-Driven Security Operations Centers (SOCs)**

In this repository, we are providing the **study instruments** and **design stimuli** accompanying an anonymous IEEE SP’26 submission on how explanation style affects analyst trust and decision-making in SOCs. The submission proposes **CORTEX**, a role- and context-aware approach to presenting explanations, and discusses a conceptual **Trust–Explainability curve** (too little rationale lowers trust; too much detail can slow triage).

## What’s included
- **/paper/** – anonymized PDF of the submission  
- **/instruments/** – the exact survey form (PDF) and the semi-structured interview protocol (PDF)  
- **/prototypes/** – static screenshots of the two SOC dashboards used as stimuli in the survey

> No human-subject data (no survey responses, no interview transcripts) are included during review.

## About the submission
- **Paper**: Context, methods, and findings overview. In PDF format.
- **Survey instrument**: 15-20 min form introducing XAI, workflow, and tooling questions, and preference questions using two dashboard screenshots.  
- **Interview protocol**: Questions on roles and workflows, triage strategies, explanation needs, and reactions to example explanations.

## Data availability (review phase)
We are **not** releasing Round-1 survey results or any interview transcripts at this time. Only instruments and static stimuli are provided so reviewers can see exactly what participants saw and were asked. Aggregated, de-identified summaries may be added **after** the review process.
